Go to [MIT's Fake CompSci Paper Generator](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/)
The rest is self-explanatory.
Here are some examples:
1.  [Paper #001](<https://github.com/vedek/publications/blob/master/scimakelatex.25977.Dr%2BBheemaiah%2BAnil%2BKumar.pdf>)
2.  [Paper #002](<https://github.com/vedek/publications/blob/master/scimakelatex.26087.Dr%2BBheemaiah%2BAnil%2BKumar.pdf>)

[Here is the code](https://github.com/strib/scigen)

[Here are the CFG rules for the generator, you can also import this and add example texts to Rita.JS](https://github.com/strib/scigen/blob/master/scirules.in)
