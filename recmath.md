# Recreational  Math Papers
Here are greate recreational math papers, full of pun and fun.....
Here are some examples:
1. [SOME ASSOCIATIVITY RESULTS FOR RANDOM VARIABLES IN STRANGE GROUPS](<https://github.com/vedek/publications/blob/master/Associativity%20in%20Strange%20Groups.pdf>)


The papers are manually edited from mathgen gibberish papers to make them have sense, the iSense.
Much of the original Gibberish is maintained in <techno-gibberish> tags to retain the fun.
